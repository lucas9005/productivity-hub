# 📦 Productivity Hub — Dev Branch Audit (Pre-Migration)

### 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-04-07 [Final Version]

## Overview

This audit captures the state of the repository before initiating the monorepo migration. It serves as the baseline to compare progress and improvements.

## Project State Summary

| Item             | Status                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Structure        | Single-app setup under `src/`         |
| Package manager  | ✅ Bun globally installed             |
| Angular          | ✅ Angular 19 standalone setup        |
| SSR              | ✅ Working on landing page `/`        |
| State management | ✅ NgRx v19 with Signals              |
| Testing          | ✅ Jest working, basic setup          |
| Linting          | ✅ ESLint + Prettier working globally |
| Git              | ✅ Clean state on `dev` branch        |
| Husky hooks      | ✅ Installed and working              |
| CI/CD            | ⏳ Basic setup, needs refinement      |

## File Structure (Pre-Monorepo)

```
src/
angular.json
package.json
tsconfig.json
jest.config.ts
.prettierrc
husky/
```

## Scripts (package.json)

- ✅ Start: `bun run start`
- ✅ Build: `bun run build`
- ✅ Test: `bun run test`
- ✅ Format: `bun run format`
- ✅ Lint: `bun run lint`
- ✅ Docs: `bun run docs`

## Notes

- Linting and testing scoped globally, not app-specific.
- Prettier works on the full codebase.
- CI/CD workflow present but minimal.
- SSR landing page working.

## Known Limitations (Before Migration)

- No modular app structure
- No isolated configs (tsconfig, eslint)
- Single `angular.json`
- Tight coupling of scripts
- Backend app not scaffolded
- CI/CD generic, not app-targeted
