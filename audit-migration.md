# 📦 Productivity Hub — Monorepo Migration Audit (Migration Branch)

### 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-04-07 [Final Version]

## Overview

This audit documents the entire migration from single-app to monorepo setup, including Angular 19 frontend. The report covers tooling, configurations, project structure, scripts, and lint/test pipelines.

## Goals of Migration

- ✅ Prepare for scalable architecture (frontend + backend apps)
- ✅ Clean separation of apps and tooling
- ✅ Maintain working state of frontend app
- ✅ Prep for future backend app scaffolding (NestJS)

## File Structure Before vs After

### Before

```
src/
angular.json
package.json
tsconfig.json
```

### After

```
apps/
  frontend/
    src/
    angular.json
    tsconfig.app.json
    tsconfig.spec.json
    tsconfig.eslint.json
    .eslintrc.json
    ...
package.json
tsconfig.json
jest.config.ts
.prettierrc
```

## Scripts (package.json)

✅ Scoped to frontend app for now:

- `bun run start`
- `bun run build`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run format`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run docs`

## Problems Fixed

- ✅ Move to monorepo structure completed
- ✅ Package.json scripts updated
- ✅ Jest paths fixed
- ✅ ESLint isolated config created
- ✅ Husky + lint-staged confirmed working

## Pending (Post-migration)

- ⏳ ESLint improvements for specs/tests
- ⏳ GitHub Actions pipeline for monorepo
- ⏳ Backend app (NestJS) scaffolding
- ⏳ Optional Nx-style tooling for workspace orchestration

## Notes

- Git hooks are working (`prepare` runs Husky install).
- CI/CD not yet adjusted for apps/ folder structure.
- tsconfig references ✅ pointing to frontend.
- Migration branch stable, ready for feature work.
